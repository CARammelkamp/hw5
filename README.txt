I completed the assignment and the ActionBar extra credit (2%).

I used the following open-source library for creating the Gingerbread-compatible ActionBar:
(1) https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock

I found out about the library from this source:
(2) stackoverflow.com/questions/6646169/actionbar-pre-honeycomb

For additional help I used the following source:
(3) http://blog.imaginea.com/android-handling-actionbar-compatibility-issues/

Link (3) was a very thorough description on how to install the library and modify your 
code to make it compatible.

For figuring out how to implement the ScaleGestureDetector, I used the following resource:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5790503/can-we-use-scale-gesture-detector-for-pinch-zoom-in-android

The "more" icon (the leftmost of the two righthand icons on the actionbar) 
allows you to choose a picture from the sdcard to scale/rotate. 
The "add" icon allows you to view the settings. The "help" icon allows 
you to view the author/version. The "help" icon does not automatically show up
on the action bar, so you need to press the bottom leftmost file-like 
icon on the Gingerbread phone to be able to access the "help" dialogbox.

Thanks!
